        <P>an object must first have a key and a value and they are separated by ':'and they should be inside {} example const intro={ name: "jane" age:20 }console.log(intro.name) </P>




        <P> We have two variables scope in javascript, that is the global variable and the local variable.Global variables are meaning that they have a global scope and they can be accessed any where in your code .A local variable is a variable that can only
            be accessed inside a block of code</P>



        <P>I really don't think the code will bring an output because the return has {}and I know you should not add {} and also it has(;) after the {}</P>
